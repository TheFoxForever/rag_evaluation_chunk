address processing inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING. When CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), the ASNs are converted to ASn1 types.
, the address is parsed in the same way as any other AS. The address field in a X.400 address has the form of a string, which is then converted into a C-style AS-STR. For example, if the C code for the field was:

X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING. When CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), the ASNs are converted to ASn1 types.

Start your answer with 'Answer':

open-source and intelligence reporting through July 2020. The target audience for this advisory is commercial sector businesses desiring to protect their networks from North Korean APT activity. Click here for a PDF version of this report. Key Findings This advisory’s key findings are: The Kimsuky APT group has most likely been operating since 2012. Kimsuky is most likely tasked by the North Korean regime with a global intelligence gathering mission. Kimsuky employs common social engineering tactics, spearphishing, and watering hole attacks to gain access to the target's network.
, the APTs are likely to be targeting the same target. This is likely due to KimSuky's history of spear phishing attacks.

Start your answer with 'Answer':

servers that are out of date or end of life (EOL) to gain access to a network and perform malicious activities. These present easy and safe locations to maintain persistence on a network. Often these services and servers are systems that have begun decommissioning, but the final stage has not been completed by shutting down the system. This means they are still running and vulnerable to compromise. Ensuring that decommissioning of systems has been completed or taking appropriate action to remove them from the network limits their susceptibility and reduces the risk of compromise by attackers.

plan. Pre-Eviction Phase Define the true scope by identifying trust boundaries (including between Active Directory [AD] forests and domains) and determining the enterprise assets to which this guidance applies (i.e., determine what assets are within the trust boundary). For example, the organization needs to determine the identity provider (IdP) sources (such as Okta, Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services [ADFS], Duo) that it uses to issue single-sign on (SSO) credentials and it needs to identify the domain controllers that are used to manage the Identity Provider. For more information, see the section on Identity Providers. Identify the assets that the Trust will use to secure the Domain Controller. The Trust needs the domains to be secure because the security of the entire domain is at stake.

VALIDATION CWE-295 The function X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() is documented to implicitly enable the certificate policy check when doing certificate verification. However the implementation of the function does not enable the check which allows certificates with invalid or incorrect policies to pass the certificate verification. As suddenly enabling the policy check could break existing deployments it was decided to keep the existing behavior of the X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() function. Instead the applications that rely on the functionality of X.509.CertificateVerify() should use the new XCertificatesPolicy() method.

need-to-know when designing network segments. Separate sensitive information and security requirements into network segments. Apply security recommendations and secure configurations to all network segments and network layers. Virtual Separation of Sensitive Information As technologies change, new strategies are developed to improve IT efficiencies and network security controls. Virtual separation is the logical isolation of networks on the same physical network. The same physical segmentation design principles apply to virtual segmentation but no additional hardware is required. Existing technologies can be used to prevent an intruder from accessing a network segment. For example, a firewall can block access to a segment by using a virtual firewall. A virtual network can also be created to isolate a particular segment from other segments on a physical computer. This virtual separation can help prevent a malicious actor from gaining access.

and OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length. However the DH_check() function checks numerous aspects of the key or parameters that have been supplied. Some of those checks use the supplied modulus value even if it has already been found to be too large. An application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulernable to a denial of service attack. The function DH_check() is itself called by OpenSSH, and it is not possible to use it to check the moduli of a given key.

2.T]. Enable enhanced PowerShell logging [CPG 2.T, 2.U]. PowerShell logs contain valuable data, including historical OS and registry interaction and possible TTPs of a threat actor’s PowerShell use. Ensure PowerShell instances, using the latest version, have module, script block, and transcription logging enabled (enhanced logging). The two logs that record PowerShell activity are the PowerShell Windows Event Log and the PowerShell Operational Log. FBI and CISA recommend turning on these two Windows Event Logs with enhanced logging.
, the Windows PowerShell log is a collection of events that are logged by Windows. The Windows Log is the log that is logged when a Windows process is started. It contains information about the process, such as the name of the running process and its name, its PID, time, memory, CPU, disk, network, etc. Windows Processes are processes that run on the computer.

as logs are generally not cleared and this is a known Volt Typhoon tactic to cover their tracks. Monitor and Review OT System Logs Review access logs for communication paths between IT and OT networks, looking for anomalous accesses or protocols. Measure the baseline of normal operations and network traffic for the industrial control system (ICS) and assess traffic anomalies for malicious activity. Configure intrusion detection systems (IDS) to create alarms for any ICS network traffic outside normal operations. Track and monitor audit trails on critical areas of ICS to identify potential security breaches.
, and the above. The above is the most common method of monitoring and reviewing OT system logs. This is also the method used by the Volt. It is important to note that the OT logs can be used to track and identify the source of any malicious traffic. If the logs show a pattern of suspicious activity, it is likely that a malicious actor is using the system to conduct a cyber attack. In addition, the log can also be a useful tool to determine",,,

successful logon Event ID 4624. Defenders should also look for abnormal account activity, such as logons outside of normal working hours and impossible time-and-distance logons (e.g., a user logging on from two geographically separated locations at the same time). Impacket The actor regularly employs the use of Impacket’s wmiexec, which redirects output to a file within the victim host's ADMIN$ share (C:\Windows\) containing an epoch timestamp in its name. This timestamp is used to determine the time of the last time the ImPacket was used. The ImPacket is a packet that is sent to the target host from the attacker's computer. It is not a message sent by the host. Im Packet is an encrypted packet sent from a computer to an attacker. An attacker can use Im packet to send a malicious message to another computer, or to trick the computer into sending a malformed packet.

of the most common initial attack vectors employed by for malware delivery and credential harvesting. Attacking the human element—considered the weakest component in every network—continues to be extremely effective. To infect a system, the attacker simply has to persuade a user to click on a link or open an attachment. The good news is that there are many indicators that you can use to quickly identify a phishing email. The best defense against these attacks is to become an educated and cautious user and familiarize yourself with the most common phish attacks.
, and the next question is:
. This question asks you to identify the first attack vector that is used by the malware to infect the victim. You can also use the same question to determine the second attack. For example, if you are a victim of a spear phisher, you should be able to tell the difference between the two attacks by looking at the response from the phishers.
